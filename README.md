CAPSTONE PROJECT - Bug Logger App - Bugger

1.- created two new repos and succesfully deployed them to heroku
    • Backend repo https://lit-caverns-62565.herokuapp.com
    • Frontend repo https://buggerf.herokuapp.com
        • both repos are up and running but are not connected through routes or axios yet.
        •

2.- started working on the frontend, by creating components and adding some vanilla css just to kick things off in the right direction. 
    • Routes from the backend seem to be working on postman, but will have to see once we fully develop CRUD.

3.- succesfully deployed frontend app into heroku wihtout any errors, this may change once the full CRUD has been achieved
    • Will keep track of ongoing bugs via the application itself. Additionally, once full CRUD functionality is met, more functionalities will be added. Such as: Search bar for all existing bugs, gatekeeper functionality, share functionality, and Auth integration will be last just to make sure that everything is running smoothly. 

4.- The Bugger app is looking good so far with the bootstrap & vanilla CSS additions. No CRUD functionality yet, as that will come tomorrow once we have established a good skeleton to work on. 

5.- Animations and transitions might be implemented if the timeline allows, THREE.JS is looking like a good option but will require some more research in order to integrate. 

6.- Friday update - finishing frontend skeleton and setting up routes
    • finished frontend HTML hardcode. Will be adding additional components tomorrow
